This site is the way I asked my friends to be my groomsmen for my wedding. It features a mission impossible style scrolling message, after the recipient inputs the 'secret id' they received via snail mail. All names and emails have been redacted from this version.

Things to search and replace to make it yours:
* redacted
* site-goes-here
* email@example.com
* (date)
* You'll also want to generally edit the messages in secure.php and respond.php
